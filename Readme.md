This project aims to implement

1. a minimal Qt version of the [Lisa Emulator](https://github.com/rayarachelian/lisaem/) with just the Lisa screen an a few controls for file loading etc. instead of a photorealistic rendering of the Lisa case and noises,
2. maximum possible performance, i.e. no throttling or waiting to emulate old hardware,
3. a new MC68000 implementation based on [Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) instead of the [Squish.net Generator](http://www.squish.net/generator/) to profit of JIT support.


NOTE that this is work in progress, not ready for primetime!

And if you wonder what EmuLisa means:

### Development history

##### Status on Feb. 3, 2025

Reorganized the original source code from the [Github repository](https://github.com/rayarachelian/lisaem/), commit a3ee183, Apr. 4, 2022. Removed everything but the minimal C/C++ header and body files used to build the application. The sources also include the cpu68k emulator generated by the [Squish.net Generator](http://www.squish.net/generator/). Added a Qt creator project file and made minimal changes to the include paths of the sources to accomodate the new organization. The code depends on wxWindows version 3.0.5. The application builds and runs on my Linux i386 machine.

### Precompiled versions

Not available at this time.

### How to build

Make sure wxWindows version 3.0.5 is available on your system. Then use the .pro file and run it with QtCreator or qmake.

This procedure so far has been tested on Linux i386.
